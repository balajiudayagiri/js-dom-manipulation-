This repository is a collection of examples and exercises demonstrating various ways to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript.

**Topics Covered:**

- **Selecting Elements:** Learn how to select HTML elements using methods like `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, `getElementsByTagName`, `querySelector`, and `querySelectorAll`.
- **Modifying Content:** Explore how to change the text content, HTML content, and attribute values of elements.
- **Styling Elements:** Discover how to add, remove, and toggle CSS classes, and how to modify inline styles.
- **Creating and Appending Elements:** Understand how to dynamically create new HTML elements and add them to the DOM.
- **Removing Elements:** Learn how to remove elements from the DOM.
- **Event Handling:** Explore how to respond to user interactions like clicks, hovers, and form submissions using event listeners.
- **Traversing the DOM:** Learn how to navigate between parent, child, and sibling elements.

**How to Use:**

Each folder within this repository typically contains an `index.html` file and one or more JavaScript files. To see the examples in action, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The JavaScript code will manipulate the DOM as the page loads or in response to user interactions.
