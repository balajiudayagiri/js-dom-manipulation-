# Dynamic List Adder

### âœ… **Create and Append List Items**

**Problem:**
When a user types a value in an input and clicks "Add", add the item to a list below.

```html
<input id="item" placeholder="Enter item" />
<button id="add-item">Add</button>
<ul id="item-list"></ul>
```

```js
// Your JS here
```

A simple web application that allows users to dynamically add items to a list using an input field and a button. This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Add Items**: Users can type text into an input field and click an "Add" button to append the text as a new item in a list.
- **Enter Key Support**: Users can also press the "Enter" key while focused on the input field to add the item.
- **Input Validation**: Prevents adding empty items (items with only whitespace).
- **User Feedback**: Clears the input field after an item is added and sets focus back to it for a smoother user experience.
- **Basic Styling**: Includes simple CSS for a clean and organized presentation.
