# Add To Cart Interaction

An interactive add-to-cart button animation. This can be used to enhance the user experience on e-commerce websites by providing a smooth animation when a user clicks the 'Add to Cart' button. The animation makes the cart icon visually respond and gives feedback to the user that the item has been added to the cart.

## 🌟 Features

- Interactive button with loading animation.
- Visual feedback for adding an item to the cart.
- Smooth CSS animations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

## 🚀 Setup and Usage

1.  **Ensure you have the files:**
    Place the following files in the same directory:

    - `index.html`
    - `style.css`
    - `script.js`

2.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser.**

## 📂 File Structure

```
.
├── index.html       # The main HTML structure for the button
├── style.css        # CSS styles for the button and animation
└── script.js        # JavaScript logic for handling click and animation state
```

## 💡 How It Works

- **`index.html`**: Provides the HTML structure for the button, including an SVG for the cart icon.
- **`style.css`**: Contains all the styling for the button's appearance and the complex keyframe animations that occur when the button is in a "loading" state.
